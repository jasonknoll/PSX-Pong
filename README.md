# PSX-Pong

An attempt to create a pong-like game on the PSX. 

Recently, I set a goal to learn how to create homebrew games for various consoles of the past. PSX seems to have a great community surrounding it alongside a decent selection of toolchains to work with. I hope to recreate many simple games as well as 'demake' some of my all-time favorite games to fit the context of the console. 

This project uses the [PsyQo](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/tree/main/psyqo) C++ framework.
