# PSX-Pong

An attempt to create a pong-like game on the PSX. 

Recently, I set a goal to learn how to create homebrew games for various consoles of the past. PSX seems to have a great community surrounding it alongside a decent selection of toolchains to work with. I hope to recreate many simple games as well as 'demake' some of my all-time favorite games to fit the context of the console. 

This project uses the [PsyQo](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget/tree/main/psyqo) C++ framework and the [PSX.DEV VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Grumpycoders.psx-dev). The extension allows you to install the necessary dependencies, build/debug the projects, as well as run them inside the [PCSX-Redux emulator](https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux).

I suggest checking out the [discord](https://discord.gg/QByKPpH) server if you want to get started developing your own PSX games.
